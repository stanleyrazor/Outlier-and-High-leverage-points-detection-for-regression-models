# Outlier-and-High-leverage-points-detection-for-regression-models
This contains two functions for outlier removal and removal of high leverage points for linear regression models

The parameters used in the two function include
Model - The linear regression model you are dealing with
d_f - The dataset used to train the linear regression model
deviations - The standard deviations used to find out if a points is an outlier
max_levpoint - The leverage points to use in order to detect high leverage points
